# QuantDim 🌌

*An innovative platform for computational exploration and repairing over-reliance on empirical models at the intersection of data, models, and human understanding*

## 🧪 About QuantDim

QuantDim is the research notebook and digital playground of a low-income computer and physical integrated scientist. It encourages socratic science, with a shift away from scientific minds praising roles as technicians of empirical practices. This space shares selected developments and explorations across multiple domains where computation meets human needs.

### Research Areas
- **Pharmacokinetics** - Computational drug modeling and dynamics
- **Social Data Analysis** - Patterns in human systems and interactions  
- **Environmental Data** - Computational ecology and climate modeling
- **Abstract Modeling** - Language, data structures, and conceptual frameworks
- **Human-Centric Design** - Reconfiguring systems to better serve human needs

## 🚀 Quick Navigation

- **[Research Hub](/research)** - Current projects and findings
- **[Model Gallery](/models)** - Interactive computational models
- **[Data Stories](/stories)** - Narrative explorations of complex systems
- **[Lab Notes](/notes)** - Raw thoughts and experimental approaches

## 🛠️ Technical Foundation

This site is built with **Jekyll** and hosted on **GitHub Pages**. The architecture emphasizes:

- **Simplicity** - Clean, readable code and minimal dependencies
- **Reproducibility** - Well-documented models and methodologies  
- **Accessibility** - Making complex topics approachable
- **Interactivity** - Where possible, models are interactive and explorable
